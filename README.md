# Fractal Fern
This project runs a simulation of a fractal generator using matrix transformations to draw a leaf.
This is based off of the mathematical phenomenon described by mathemtatician Michael Barnsley to create a fractal known as a [Barnsley fern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern).

## Prerequisites
* Python graphics library - graphics.py
  * How to Install:
  ```pip install graphics.py --user```

## How to Run
* Simply run the python program using the python interpreter
```python fractal_fern.py```
* Or just execute the program normally
```./fractal_fern.py```
